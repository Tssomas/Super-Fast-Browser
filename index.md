# Super Fast Browser update information

This GitHub Pages site is for anyone interested in keeping up to date with all the latest changes in the Super Fast Browser project.
This will go into detail about almost everything changed; even the little things. If not for my users to keep up to date, this will at least act as a check list for me.

You can check the [AesirApps website](http://www.aesirapps.com) to see the latest published updates, and other new projects.

## Whats new
*Items that have a ~~strike~~ have been implemented and are ready to be published in the next update.*
